A fishway project in the Eel River, Northern California, involves the creation of a fish lift to help salmonids navigate a 50-foot (15.2 m) high dam. The project is managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and is subject to biological monitoring. The total cost is $250,000, and the project started in 2020 and ended in 2022. The fishway includes a series of basins and a fish pass to help fish navigate the dam. It also includes a fish trap to help prevent the entry of non-native species. The project is realized in the Eel River and is subject to both biological and hydromorphological monitoring. Both fishway and fish trap are considered effective in terms of fish passage
