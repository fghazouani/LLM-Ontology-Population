The restoration project in Kembs, France, managed by EDF and designed by CIRCE-EDF, includes three fishways (one with a modern fish pass inspired by that of Gambsheim, one for Castor Canadensis mammals, and another to connect the Grand Canal of Alsace to the PCA nature reserve), as well as a small dam for water regulation. The main contractor is EDF, and it was started in 2011 with some installations being made operational in 2013. The cost is 750,000 euros, funded by the Agency of Water Resources Rhine Meuse. No biological or hydro-morphological monitoring is planned.

Question
A reconnection project between the Rhine river and the Grand Canal of Alsace has been realized in Kembs, France. It involves a new fish lift system, a baffle fish passage, a weir replacement, and a pool creation. Managed by EDF, the project also includes the installation of a fish trap and a viewing window. Both sides have ramps. The project starts at point zero, while the end point is located directly opposite. The cost is estimated at 700,000 Euros, including both direct costs and indirect ones.
A fish lift system will be installed to help migratory species overcome a height difference of 2 meters. The project began in 1998 and is expected to finish in 2020. Biological monitoring is not required but may be considered if needed. Geomorphological monitoring will start after the first year and continue until completion.
Both bank stabilization and channel improvement are included in this project. Bank stability work mainly focuses on improving erosion areas, while channel improvement includes widening, deepening, and straightening sections. All together these measures aim to improve habitat continuity along the river's longitudinal profile.
The project is subject to European Union funding under the LIFE program. It is overseen by the French government and managed by the local municipality. The main contractor is Société française des Ponts. The designer is the Regional Directorate of Public Works. Both parties share responsibility for any potential environmental impacts.
