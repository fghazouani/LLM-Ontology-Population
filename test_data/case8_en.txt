A pool-and-weir fishway project was completed in January 2003 in the Santa Ynez River Watershed, Central California, to improve passage for adult and juvenile steelhead/rainbow trout. The existing concrete grade control structure, located 70 ft (21 m) downstream of the Jalama Road Bridge, created a 4 ft (1.2 m) drop that blocked fish movement while protecting the bridge from scour and serving as a streamflow control. The retrofit involved constructing a pool-and-weir ladder recessed about 3 ft (0.9 m) into the mudstone bedrock. Although fish ladders are generally less preferred for retrofits due to debris and sediment issues, this solution was chosen as the most suitable given site and cost constraints. The project cost $87,510 and was funded by the Cachuma Conservation Release Board, Entrix, Inc., Allen and Robert Larson, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the Coastal Conservancy.
