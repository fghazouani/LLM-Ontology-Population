A hybrid pool-and-weir fishway was completed in November 2001 on Little French Creek at its confluence with the Trinity River, Northern California, to improve passage for adult salmonids. The project, led by Caltrans in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Game and the National Marine Fisheries Service, replaced a damaged wooden Denil fishway and rubble masonry pools retrofitted in the 1970s. The new 97 ft (29.6 m) fishway includes 20 concrete pools and removable wood baffles, accommodating a total head loss of 19.3 ft (5.9 m). Its compact design, partially sunken into the bank and aesthetically treated to blend with the environment, improves flow management, debris removal, and fish passage. Funded by Caltrans, the project cost \$445,000 and included follow-up plantings. Adult salmonids were observed in the upper pools and upstream of the culvert after completion.
