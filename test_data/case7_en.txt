A restoration project in the Santa Ynez River Watershed, Central California, retrofitted a concrete and rock grade control apron downstream of the Highway 1 bridge with a step-pool fishway to improve steelhead passage at low flows. The 40 ft (12.2 m) apron previously blocked fish movement under 20 cfs (0.57 cms) flows. The project added three small step-pools and a 30 ft (9.1 m) concrete sidewall to direct low flows into the pools, improving passage conditions while preserving the structure’s function. Completed in January 2002 for $87,000, it was funded by the Cachuma Conservation and Release Board, Entrix, Inc., Allen and Robert Larson, and the California Coastal Conservancy.
