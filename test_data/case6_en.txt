A concrete pool and vortex weir fishway was completed in November 2003 on Peacock Creek in the Smith River Basin, Northern California, to improve fish passage at a high-priority road crossing. The site required maintaining a 7 ft (2.1 m) drop over 120 ft (37 m), and a concrete fishway was chosen for stability. The fishway includes vortex-shaped weirs with 8 in (0.2 m) drops to facilitate juvenile passage, enhance scouring, and maintain pool depth. The 120 ft (37 m) fishway is 20 ft (6.1 m) wide, with pools spaced every 10 ft (3 m) and 2.5 ft (0.8 m) deep, and weir side slopes of 5:1 (H:V) to concentrate flows and provide well-defined leap edges for juveniles. Funded by Del Norte County, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the Coastal Conservancy, the project cost approximately $474,000.
