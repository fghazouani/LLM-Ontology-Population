A concrete fishway project was completed in November 2002 in the Mad River Basin, Northern California, to restore fish passage. The previous culvert was a total barrier to fish and frequently caused road overtopping due to wood blockages. The new structure, designed to allow juvenile salmonid passage, includes a 70-foot (21.4 m) fishway with weirs having drops of less than 0.6 ft (0.17 m). To manage a total grade change of 9 ft (2.7 m), additional rock grade control was installed upstream and downstream. The project, funded by Humboldt County and the California Department of Fish and Game, cost approximately $171,000.
